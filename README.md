# Creative Coding with P5.js ( Course 2 - Intermediate)

This course was developed for Google's [Code Next](https://codenext.withgoogle.com) program, which focuses on preparing the next generation of Black, Latinx and Indigenous tech leaders.

Creative Coding 2 follows the orignial course which has introduced thousands of high school students to programming in JavaScript. 

This repo contains the instructional sketches used in Part 2, however the curriculum materials for the cousre are not publically available. Each folder contains a standalone sketch, 
either a demo, challenge, starter code, or finished exemplar aligned to the learning objectives. These are all also hosted on the [p5js.org site as a collection](https://editor.p5js.org/codenext/collections/_5wuwyRYG).

- Object oriented programming
- Object lifecycle

## Pedagogy
The course uses a PBL approach, and concepts are introduced with scaffolding, including example demos and mini-challenges, with oppen-ended projects at the ened of each unit. 
In many instances, the course relies on the [PRIMM method](https://computingeducationresearch.org/projects/primm/) of learning to code.
